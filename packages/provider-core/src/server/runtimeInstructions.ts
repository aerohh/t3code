const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
Link each PR you create, take over, or push to: one link_pull_request per PR, full URL, every stack layer, as your next call. Host tools do not link for you. If linking fails, say so. Skip PRs you only read or review, and PRs named only as background. Call watch_pull_request when asked to monitor or babysit, or when work you were asked to do, such as a merge, still waits on checks or reviews, even after an earlier unwatch. Finish any needed branch update and push first, then watch and end your turn. Otherwise act now or hand back. Delegated children never watch, even if the brief says babysit. After PR work, a child's last line is: PR <full URL>, head <SHA>, checks and reviews <state>. Links and watches persist across pushes. Never wait with sleep, loops, gh --watch, Monitor, or ScheduleWakeup. Before handback, call unwatch_pull_request on any PR you watch.

const THREAD_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS = `<thread_summary>
When the t3-code MCP server exposes t3_thread_update, keep this thread's summary current with action='update_summary'. The user reads it to see where the thread stands without scrolling back. Write the first one once the thread's purpose is clear. Before ending a later turn, update it only if the purpose, the outcome, or the open items changed; skip it for small follow-ups and passing questions. Each update replaces the whole summary. Write for someone new to the subject, in short plain sentences, without file names or code. about: what the thread is for and what has happened so far. verdict: where things stand now. stillOpen: each unresolved item or decision waiting on the user, empty when nothing is open. As a delegated child task, skip this.
